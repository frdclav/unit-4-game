## What the project does
* This project is a simple rpg battle game. The page itself uses bootstrap. The player first chooses a fighter, the characters chosen become the enemies. Player then chooses an enemy and attacks. The player wins when they defeat all enemies. The player fighter starts with a base attack and that attack increases every time. Enemies have a base counter attack power that doesn't increase over time.
## Why the project is useful
* This project provides an example of javascript and object notation and uses jquery to dynamically change things on the page
## How users can get started with the project
* main javascript code is in game.js
